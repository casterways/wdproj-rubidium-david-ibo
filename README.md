# "Star Clicker"


---
### Description
Title description: 

Our website, Star Clicker, is inspired by the game Cookie Clicker, though as the name suggests, instead of clicking cookies, you will click a star.

Main description: 

Star Clicker is played by clicking on a star to gain more currency. The currency in this game is called “Stars”. Your main goal would be to earn as many stars as possible. You can earn more stars per click by using said stars in the Amulet Shop. This shop is based on a luck-based rolling feature / Gacha System. This rolling feature helps the user collect stars more efficiently by boosting the production of their currency. 

These amulets come in sets that will increase in price as you progress throughout the game being able to purchase more of these sets. These sets will usually be based on a different theme for each set. The more expensive sets will contain amulets with greater rewards. The rarer the amulet, the greater the reward.

You will also be able to prestige. Instead of having star bonuses like the amulets, prestiging will grant multipliers to your stars per click. However, this will come at a cost.

Navigation of these pages will be on the top part of each webpage. The copyright is found at the bottom.

### Outlines
We will have 3 pages:

1. Star Clicker (Main Page)

- This is where the majority of the game will be played. This will be the page where you will be able to earn currency to spend on different parts of the game.

- This page will be divided into 3 different parts, the middle section will be where you click the star. The left side will display all the amulets that you have collected. The right side will display the player’s stats. 

- These stats will include Star Bonus, Star Multiplier, and Stars earned per click.

- Randomly generated quote at the bottom for fun.



2. Amulet Gacha/shop UI

- This will serve as the page where the Amulet Shop is located, containing the gacha system. The user can navigate to the shop by clicking on the button with the label “Amulet Shop”. 

- Here you will find the different sets of these amulets. Above the set will be its name, while at the bottom will be its price.

- Clicking on a set will show a pop-up that will allow you to view the different amulets that you could obtain, as well as their respective chances of being pulled ex.(60%, 35%...).



3. Prestige

- The Prestige page serves as the location where when the player reaches a certain required set of amulets, the player can “sacrifice” these amulets to prestige and get a better star multiplier. 

- The Presteiging system has levels 5 levels in this order: bronze-silver-gold-diamond-supreme. 

- Each level provides different buffs namely Bronze (1-5x multiplier), Silver (6-10x multiplier), Gold (20-25x multiplier), Diamond (30-40x multiplier), and Supreme (50-100x multiplier). [Multipliers are not final and are subject to change]

### JS Implementation
Implementing Javascript into our website will be a big part of it. It will be used to store the data when progressing through the game and put functions to the different buttons that would be used for navigation, the star used to generate currency, gacha, and many more. 

Javascript will play a big role in the project, as It will be used in the way of getting currency, checking for multipliers/bonuses, and applying them. It would also be used to go to different parts of the game such as the gacha and prestige. The gacha system will also require JavaScript as it will handle the random probability of getting a specific amulet as well as applying the bonuses attached to the amulet. This applies too for the multipliers involved with prestiging. Javascript will be the backbone of our game as without it it would not work at all.
